Custom man page for our shell

Simple shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read
from the standars input and due to the environment's built in variable the
shell can be limited.

It doesn't handle piping,redirecting,pattern matching,variable expansions and
more other functions.

Simple shell can be invoked when the user types ./shell as well as
the shell shell can be invoked ia piping example:
(echo "/bin/ls" | ./shell)

So when the command have been splited into words and found out that its a
simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are
taken.

If the command name just from the user input doesn't containe  slashes
the shell attemps to locate it and if it exist the it is invoked and when
its not found there is a look on the shell main builtin's and if
found in there it will be invoked there after if the none of the above
matches the name of the command the the simple shell will conduct a research
in the environmental variables PATH for a directory containing an executable
file by that matches the name of the command.

For the research failure she simple shell will print an error message that
the file or directory not found.

Some of the functions:
>pwd(prints the working directory)
>whereis(prints the standard output which directory the function or shell
builtin can be found)
>cd(changes the working directory)
>env(prints the environmental variables)
>exit(exits from the simple shell out to the user's original shell)
>setenv(creates non-existing environmental variables within the shell sesion
or edit the existing ones)
>unsetenv(removes existing environment variable within shell seesion)

Thanks enjoy the simple shell
